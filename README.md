# JayTee_Projects
A collection of workshop projects, machining plans, electronics builds, and general makes documented alongside my YouTube channel.  Each project includes drawings, files, and revision history where applicable.  These builds are part of my ongoing effort to properly document what I make, rather than letting it all live in memory.
